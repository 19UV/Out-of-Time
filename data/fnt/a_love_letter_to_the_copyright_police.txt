Dear whoever reads this,

The font "Out of Time" is a font created by the programmer for the game "Out of Time".
The name the font was created under was an account that we (the developers) used previously.
The font is original material. Please do not dock points.

Thanks,
People who can't have their names disclosed

P.S. I'm surprised you found this.
